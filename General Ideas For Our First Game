What kind of characters are there? Human, animal…?
Are we going to create sprites and sound effects or buy/download pre-made ones?
-Mark suggests getting free sprites and modifying them
-Mark suggests creating our own sound effects - he is going to modify them himself. 
Music? Same question^


IDEAS: -- (put your name in parentheses before what you edit so we all know who updates what)
(Alan) - I envision this game being simple with simple objectives. The classic level-to-level progression. Perhaps it can be a game that even makes fun of itself and the developers(us).
Protagonist is the user-controlled character. 
-Ideas for the protagonist:
  -Male/Female option
  -Should have charming or funny dialogue that is said after doing certain actions in-game like getting a multi-kill or after taking damage. 
  -An example I can think of is… Say the character is idle for more than 5 seconds, the character will be say something like, “Hey, player! Quit screwin’ around and play the game!” - We could even give this game kind of a Deadpool feel to it. (Without totally ripping off Deadpool).
Fight enemies each level to progress
-Ideas for type of enemies:
  -There could be a theme like zombies, bugs, whatever… Brainstorm.
  -
The gameplay should be charming, funny, and light-hearted.
-When enemies die, maybe they should make a funny noise or maybe utter dying words that are charming or funny.
